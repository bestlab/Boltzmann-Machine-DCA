This program (dwDCA) implements a version of direct coupling analysis (DCA)
[ref] to fit a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to a Potts model or to a
double-well (dw) Potts model [Tian & Best, 2020]. It uses a Boltzmann
machine learning algorithm to maximize the likelihood of the model. The 
resulting parameters are the primary output of the program.
